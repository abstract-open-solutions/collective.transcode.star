Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.transcode is a Plone product that offers transcoding services
        for Archetypes content. It works out of the box with standard Plone Files, 
        providing transcoding to mp4 and ogv for video files. Additionally, it can be
        configured through the Plone Control Panel, to work with any custom AT content
        type. 
        
        The media transcoding and serving are done by one or more collective.transcode.daemon instances, which are intelligently load balanced by collective.transcode.
